% Problem 4

\begin{problem}{17 - (Page 15 - R. C. Hibbeler $14^{th}$ ed.)}
    A concrete column has a diameter of 350 mm and
    a length of 2 m. If the density (mass/volume) of concrete is
    $2.45\text{ Mg/m}^3$, determine the weight of the column.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    For this problem we use the volume of the column times the density of concrete to find the answer, we just need to make sure our units are the same.
