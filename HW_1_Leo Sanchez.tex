% Problem 4
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}{17 - (Page 15 - R. C. Hibbeler $14^{th}$ ed.)}
    A concrete column has a diameter of 350 mm and
    a length of 2 m. If the density (mass/volume) of concrete is
    $2.45\text{ Mg/m}^3$, determine the weight of the column.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    For this problem we use the volume of the column times the density of concrete to find the answer, we just need to make sure our units are the same.
\[350 \text{ mm}\times \cfrac{1\text{ m}}{10^3 \text{ mm}}=\cfrac{350 \cancel{\text{ mm}} \times 1\text{ m}}{10^3 \cancel{\text{ mm}}}=350 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}\]
\[\phi =  0.350 \text{ m}\]
The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[V=\pi r^2 h\]
replacing the values,
\[V=\pi \cdot \left(\cfrac{0.350}{2}\right)^2 \cdot 2=2\cdot 0.030625\pi=0.19\underline{2}\,422\,550\,032\]
\[0.192\text{ m³}\]
\[\cfrac{2.45 \times 10^6 \text{ g}}{\text{m³}} \cdot 0.192 \text{ m³}=\cfrac{2.45 \times 10^6 \text{ g}\cdot 0.192 \cancel{\text{ m³}}}{\cancel{\text{m³}}} =47\underline{0}\,400\text{ g}\]
kg is a mass unit measure, so we have to convert it to newtons (N) which is the correct unit for weight, and it is give by the formula:
\[W=m\cdot g\]
where $g$ is gravity and its value for our calculations is 9.81 m/s².
\[W=470.4 \text{ kg} \cdot 9.81 = 4\, 6\underline{1}4.624=\boxed{4.62 \text{ kN}}\]

% Problem 5

\begin{problem}{20 - (Page 15 - R. C. Hibbeler $14^{th}$ ed.)}
    Evaluate each of the following to three significant
figures and express each answer in SI units using an
appropriate prefix: (a) $(200 \text{ kN})^2$, (b) $(0.005\text{ mm})^2$, and (c)
$(400\text{ m})^3$.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
 (a)
 \[(200 \text{ kN})^2=(200 \times 10^3 \times \text{N})^2=(200)^2\times 10^{3\times 2}\times (\text{N})^2\]
 \[40\, 000 \times 10^6 \text{ N²} =40 \times 10^9 \text{ N²}=\boxed{ 40.0 \text{ GN²}}\]
 (b)
 \[(0.005\text{ mm})^2=(0.005)^2 \times (10^{-3})^2 \times (\text{m})^2 =0.000\,025 \times 10^{-6} \times \text{m²}\]
 \[0.025 \times 10^{-9}\times\text{m²}=\boxed{0.025\,0 \text{ nm²}}\text{ or } \boxed{25.0 \text{ pm²}}\]
 (c)
 \[(400\text{ m})^3=(400)^3\times(m)^3=64\,000\,000\text{ m³}\]
 \[64 \times 10^6 \text{ m³}=\boxed{ 64.0 \text{ Mm³}}\]
